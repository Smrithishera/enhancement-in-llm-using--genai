# Enhancing Data Quality and Model Performance in Large Language Models (LLMs) Using Generative AI 

# Objective:
Developed a system that utilizes Generative AI to improve the quality of training data for Large Language Models. This system will enhance model performance by generating synthetic data to augment existing datasets, performing data cleaning and improving data diversity.

# Project Components:
**Data Collection and Preparation:**

Gathered Large Datasets: Use publicly available datasets like Common Crawl, Wikipedia, and other text corpora relevant to the domain.

Data Cleaning and Curation: Implemented techniques to clean the data, removing noise, duplicates, and irrelevant information. Developed scripts that automatically detected and fixed inconsistencies in the dataset.


**Generative Data Augmentation:**

Synthetic Data Generation: Used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic text data that closely resembles the original dataset. 

Data Diversity Enhancement: Created variations in the data by altering sentence structures, vocabulary, and context while maintaining semantic meaning. This increased the diversity of the training data, leading to better generalization.


**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Baseline Model: Trained an initial version of an LLM (BERT) using the original dataset to establish a performance baseline.

Model Training with Augmented Data: Retrained the model with the augmented dataset and compare its performance with the baseline ith a focus on metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and perplexity.


**Data Quality Assessment:**

Human Evaluation: Conducted human evaluations to assess the quality of the original vs. synthetic data.

Automated Quality Metrics: Implemented automated metrics to evaluate the quality of both the original and generated data. 


**Cross-Functional Collaboration:**

Feedback Loop: Established a feedback loop where model performance is continuously monitored, and data quality improvements are iteratively applied.


**Visualization and Reporting:**

Data Visualization: Created visualizations using Looker to showcase the differences in data quality before and after augmentation. 

Reporting: Highlighted the impact of data quality improvements on model performance and product outcomes.
